# TODO - Jamesium Industries — Project

## Core mod / infrastructure
- [ ] Test current loot/gift implementation thoroughly
- [ ] Refactor growing bootstrap/main-class responsibilities
- [ ] Move datagen provider wiring out of `JamesiumIndustries`
- [ ] Consider an `event/` package as event handling grows

## Datagen
- [ ] Extract datagen registration/wiring from main mod class
- [ ] Keep individual providers in `datagen/`
- [ ] Centralise loot-table `ResourceKeys`/constants
- [ ] Reduce `JamesiumIndustries` toward boring bootstrap/registration duties

## Pet Rabbit

### Mob / Pet Interaction
- [ ] Ownership/taming semantics
- [ ] Follow owner behaviour
- [ ] Sit/stay behaviour
- [ ] Additional pet AI goals

### Variant Changing Interactions
- [ ] Allow offered `ItemStacks` to transform rabbit variants
- [ ] Gold ingot → appropriate gold rabbit variant
- [ ] Gold rabbit → influence gift production toward gold nuggets
- [ ] Wither rose or wither skeleton skull → EVIL/Killer Bunny
- [ ] Transformations consume the offered item
- [ ] Determine whether other vanilla rabbit variants deserve corresponding transformation items

### Loot Tables / Periodic Gifts
- [ ] Have datagen and runtime share the same `PET_RABBIT_GIFT` key
- [ ] Tune weights/counts/drop rates after playing with it

### Seasonal Gifts
- [ ] Add `isEasterSeason()`
- [ ] Use deliberately broad Easter season rather than implementing ecclesiastical computus
- [ ] Approximate season: 1 March → 1 May
- [ ] Create Easter gift loot table
- [ ] Add enhanced Easter loot such as emeralds/diamonds
- [ ] Decide how seasonal table selection interacts with rabbit variants
- [ ] Make seasonal date logic easy enough to test without waiting until March

## Canada Expansion Pack

### Grizzly bear
- [ ] Research best vanilla entity to extend/use as architectural reference
- [ ] Create Canadian grizzly bear
- [ ] Custom model/texture as required
- [ ] Make grizzly a pet
- [ ] Ownership/taming
- [ ] Make grizzly rideable
- [ ] Research passenger/mount mechanics
- [ ] Determine how player controls ridden bear
- [ ] Add combat behaviour
- [ ] Attack hostile/appropriate targets
- [ ] Determine whether bear protects owner
- [ ] Add bear-specific sounds/animations if warranted

#### Honey
- [ ] Bear periodically produces little potion bottles of honey
- [ ] Decide whether these are custom items or actual potion-like consumables
- [ ] Decide effects
- [ ] Create item/texture
- [ ] Create bear gift loot table
- [ ] Reuse/generalise periodic gift architecture where sensible

# BACKLOG

## Canada Expansion Pack

### Maple Trees
Intentionally postponded because #WORLDGEN
- [ ] Decide whether we're really doing this
- [ ] Accept that yes, eventually we're probably doing this
- [ ] Research tree/worldgen APIs
- [ ] Maple log
- [ ] Maple wood
- [ ] Stripped maple log
- [ ] Stripped maple wood
- [ ] Maple planks
- [ ] Maple leaves
- [ ] Maple sapling
- [ ] Generate appropriate block/item models
- [ ] Generate blockstates
- [ ] Generate loot tables
- [ ] Generate recipes
- [ ] Add wood-family blocks as desired:
    - [ ] stairs
    - [ ] slabs
    - [ ] fences
    - [ ] gates
    - [ ] doors
    - [ ] trapdoors
    - [ ] buttons
    - [ ] pressure plates
    - [ ] signs, etc.
- [ ] Make maple saplings grow
- [ ] World generation / natural maple trees
- [ ] Decide biome placement
- [ ] Eventually realise maple trees imply maple sap
- [ ] Eventually realise maple sap implies maple syrup

## Research rabbit holes deliberately deferred
- [ ] Synched entity data when a feature actually needs client/server state synchronisation
- [ ] Persistent custom pet state when a feature actually needs to survive save/reload
- [ ] Ownership UUID persistence
- [ ] More advanced AI goal architecture
- [ ] Custom entity rendering/models
- [ ] Worldgen
- [ ] Data components for stateful items where appropriate
- [ ] Loot contexts beyond `EMPTY` when gift generation actually needs contextual information
- [ ] GitHub Releases/CD when distributing builds becomes worthwhile
